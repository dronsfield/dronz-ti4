</p><h2><span id="FAQ"><span>FAQ</span></span><span></span></h2>
<p><b>Q:</b> Can Vortex be used on a ship if a player doesn't have any of those ships in their reinforcements?
</p><p><b>A:</b> No, since they cannot fully resolve Vortex.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q:</b> Are systems that contain Vuil’raith Cabal’s Dimensional Tears anomalies?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, any game effect that references an anomaly includes systems containing Dimensional Tears.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can the Vuil’raith Cabal use their agent on someone who has their Trade Agreement used to take their commodities?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, the commodities would not be there but the agent could still be used to capture a ship up to the player’s commodity value.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q:</b> Does the Cabal Flagship capture other units that are destroyed in the same timing window in which it is destroyed?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q:</b> What happens to captured units when the owner is eliminated?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Captured units remain on the sheet of the player that captured them. If they would ever be returned to the eliminated player, they are returned to the game box instead
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can a ship benefit from the Vuil'raith Cabal promissory note, The Crucible, if it would not be able to reach a gravity rift on the way to the active system without it?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, once a system has been activated and The Crucible has been played, the bonus would apply to all ships that can make it to the active system, including the bonuses from the promissory and the rift they are passing through.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q:</b> Does Cabal Agent count as "converting your own commodities," or is the Cabal player converting them for the purpose of Pillage?
</p><p><b>A:</b> No, whenever commodities are converted to a player’s own trade good area, they are not considered gained.
