</p><h2><span id="FAQ"><span>FAQ</span></span><span></span></h2>
<p><b>Q:</b> When a player gives you their commodities and triggers Dark Pact, do you gain all the trade goods simultaneously or the Dark Pact TG separately? (For the purposes of Pillage)
</p><p><b>A:</b> It is a single gain of commodities and 1 TG simultaneously.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can the Empyrean flagship be used to repair the same ship, multiple times in the same combat round? Can it spend a 4 influence planet to use the ability twice?
</p><p><b>A:</b> The Dynamo’s ability can be used multiple times in the same combat round by spending 2 influence, individually, each time. However, the same unit could not use its Sustain Damage ability multiple times during the same timing window.
