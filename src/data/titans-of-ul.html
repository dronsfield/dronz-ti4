</p><h2><span id="FAQ"><span>FAQ</span></span><span><span>[</span><span></span><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p><b>Q:</b> Hel Titans cannot be <span>transported</span> but can they be moved by use of the technology <span>Transit Diodes</span>? 
</p><p><b>A:</b> Since Transit Diodes uses the terms "remove" and "place" it may be used to move Hel Titans.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> Can Hel Titans be destroyed by <span>Bombardment</span>? 
</p><p><b>A:</b> Since Hel Titans are treated as <span>ground forces</span>, they may be bombarded; provided the player bombarding has a unit or <span>ability</span> that is capable of bypassing their <span>Planetary Shield</span> ability.    
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> If you awaken a sleeper token or deploy your flagship and then your turn ends (Mahact mech, Nullification field, Minister of Peace), do you resolve combat?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Coalescence forces combat steps to occur. No other steps of the tactical action occur, and abilities can only be used within combat.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> If Titans of Ul have their commander, Tungstantus, unlocked and have 2 TGs and go to production to gain a third and build a carrier, is that TG able to be pillaged?
</p><p><b>A</b>: The gain and spend are simultaneous, so cannot be pillaged.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> Does the Titans of Ul promissory note “Terraform” count for the purposes of objectives like “Strengthen Bonds” or “Betray a Friend”?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, when Terraform is attached to a planet it counts as being in that planet owner’s play area.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> Does 63.3 (2 PDS on a planet max) mean that Titans couldn't commit Hel-Titans using the Sardakk commander, or place a PDS via Sleeper token onto a planet where another player already has 2 PDS? Related, if a planet has 2 PDS on it already can you DEPLOY the Titan’s mech there, given that the mech is "when you would place a PDS"?
</p><p><b>A:</b> 63.3 does not prevent Titans from deploying a PDS. You cannot place a structure on a planet with the maximum number of your structures, which prevents using the DEPLOY ability on a planet with 2 PDS, or placing more PDS than would be allowed using Transit Diodes. You also cannot DEPLOY a mech if you have no PDS in reinforcements, but could remove a PDS from the board and then DEPLOY your mech.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> If the Titans Agent is used to cancel the only hit “when” it is generated against a player that has Valkyrie Particle Weave as a technology, does VPW trigger?
</p><p><b>A:</b> The Titan’s Agent will&nbsp; receive an errata to have the same timing as Shields Holding or Sustain Damage. “Before you assign a hit”.  The hit is still produced, VPW triggers, then the hit is canceled.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> Can the Titans Hel-Titan move via abilities like the action card Ghost Squad or via the Sardakk N’orr Alliance?
</p><p><b>A:</b> No, structures cannot move.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: Does the Geoform ability of Ul the progenitor count as an attachment for the purpose of the objective "Reclaim ancient monuments"?
</p><p><b>A</b>: Yes.
