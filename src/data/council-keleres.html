<h2><span id="FAQ"><span>FAQ</span></span><span><span>[</span><span></span><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p><b>Q</b>: Can the Keleres Hero ability "Overwing Zeta" be used during a combat in which you are not participating in?
</p><p><b>A:</b> No, any non-agent “at the start of a combat” abilities must be played during a combat you are participating in.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: What is the duration of the Council Keleres agent, Xander Alexin Victori III?
</p><p><b>A:</b> The agent is exhausted at the time the commodities would be spent as trade goods, and only lasts for the duration of that spend.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> What is the order of gaining starting technology when Winnu and/or Argent Flight are in a game with Council Keleres? What if there are not two unique starting technologies at the beginning of the game?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Keleres selects after all other players have selected their starting technology. Keleres only gets one starting technology if there is only one other starting technology among all other factions at the table.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> Does Custodia Vigilia's PRODUCTION count as a unit for sarween tools, etc.?
</p><p><b>A</b>: Yes, Custodia Vigilia should include “as if it were a unit”.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> Does Custodia Vigilia count as a planet for objectives? Agendas? Do you gain it exhausted like a planet? Can it be terraformed (if yes, can it be explored)? Nano-Forged? Can units be placed on it? Can the Keleres player be eliminated with it in game?
</p><p><b>A:</b> This planet is not on the game board, and does not exist in a system. It is gained exhausted. It counts as a planet for objectives and agendas if it meets the specific criteria of those objectives and agendas. Terraform can be placed on it (Nano-Forge cannot since it is a legendary planet), but their attachment tokens are not placed on the game board. It may be explored, however units cannot be placed on it. Keleres cannot be eliminated if they control Custodia Vigilia.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: Does Custodia Vigilia give command tokens when a player scores public objectives off Imperial?
</p><p><b>A:</b> No, the intent is that the tokens are only gained off of using Imperial’s ability to gain a Victory Point because you control Mecatol Rex.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: How does the influence payment for the Council Keleres mech, Omniopiares, stack in multiples? Each a separate payment?
</p><p><b>A</b>: Each mech is one instance of spend one influence.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: With Agency Supply Network, can you use it on the same unit? Does it trigger Sarween Tools each time? Can you use it on a second dock in a system for a separate use of Sarween? How about off&nbsp; of the Warfare secondary? Does it trigger a single unit's PRODUCTION, or an entire system's?
</p><p><b>A</b>: No, the second PRODUCTION instance must be different than one of the units that used the ability to trigger Agency Supply Network. Yes, Sarween Tools would trigger with each instance of PRODUCTION (twice). PRODUCTION is all or nothing during tactical actions, so you couldn’t choose to only use one ability in a system to then use another one in the same system. However, Warfare would allow you to do this, since it specifically says one space dock, Agency Supply Network could be used to use PRODUCTION at a second unit in the same system.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: How does the Council Keleres faction ability Law's Order interact with Minister of Peace/more than 2 PDS on a planet law?
</p><p><b>A</b>: All agendas are treated as blank for all players for the duration of that Council Keleres player’s turn.<br>
