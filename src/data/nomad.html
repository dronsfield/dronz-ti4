<p><b>Q</b>: Does the Duranium Armor technology allow you to repair Nomad Mechs that have used their ability to cancel a hit during space combat?
</p><p><b>A</b>: No, Duranium Armor only affects units participating (rolling dice) in a combat.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: Does Nomad’s Temporal Command Suite faction technology bypass transaction limits?
</p><p><b>A</b>: Yes, Temporal Command Suite’s transaction does not affect performing a second transaction with the same player that turn.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: Does the Nomad’s Hero, Ahk-Syl Siven, allow their flagship to pick up groundforces in systems that contain their tokens?
</p><p><b>A</b>: Yes.

<h2><span id="Trivia">Trivia</span><span><span>[</span><span></span><span>]</span></span></h2>
<ul><li>According to Dane Beltrami<sup>[1]</sup>, the Nomad claims to come from the future, despite their faction sheet never explicitly stating this. The following factors point to this being true:
<ul><li>Their emergence shortly after and deep interest in the Acheron disaster.</li>
<li>Quickly gaining recognition out of no where with seemingly infinite wealth and resources.</li>
<li>Having an agent able to revert time.</li>
<li>Having an ability called "Future Sight".</li>
<li>Starting with their flagship.</li></ul></li>
<li>The Nomad was accompanied by The Company, the five characters that make up the Nomad faction's leaders.<sup>[1]</sup>
<ul><li>Artuno the Betrayer is in charge of the Space Station Sumerian at the behest of the Nomad, and answers to the Nomad. <sup>[1]</sup></li></ul></li>
<li>The subtitle for the Nomad's hero Ahk-Syl Siven is "Sole Survivor", which according to Dane Beltrami<sup>[1]</sup> is because he is (supposedly) the last living Creuss in the future from which the Nomad comes.
<ul><li>Alternatively, it would make sense for him to be the sole survivor of the <span>Creuss expedition to Acheron</span></li></ul></li>
<li>In the Aug 2020 <span>Reddit AMA</span>, Dane Beltrami confirmed that the Nomad's Flagship, Memoria, is a reference to the penultimate dungeon of Final Fantasy IX.
<ul><li>Memoria is Latin for 'Memory' or, specifically, the ability to remember/recall the Arguments of a Discourse.</li></ul></li></ul>
