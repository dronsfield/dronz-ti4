<p><b>Q: </b>Does the Hacan player have to initiate negotiations in order to <span>transact</span> with a player who is not their neighbor?
</p><p><b>A: </b>So long as the active player is involved in the transaction, either player may suggest the opening of negotiations, on either player’s turn.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q</b>: Can Hacan trade action cards after having Political Secret played against them? &nbsp;
</p><p><b>A</b>: Arbiters is a passive ability and the Emirates of Hacan can trade Action cards regardless of having their Political Secret played against them.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q</b>: What happens if the Emirates of Hacan trade a planet during combat using their mech’s ability? Particularly when combined with Integrated Economy or the Nomad faction technology Temporal Command Suite?
</p><p><b>A</b>: A planet that has the Hacan Mech can’t be traded in combat. You can’t produce ground forces on a planet with another player’s ground forces. Future errata will clarify this.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> Can I use the Nekro Virus’ Agent, Nekro Malleon, or Psychoarchaeology or the Hacan Agent to interrupt another ability since the timing is “during the action phase”?
</p><p><b>A</b>: No, any ability that is used “during the action phase” cannot be resolved unless there are no other abilities currently being resolved.
