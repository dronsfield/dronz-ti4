<p><b>Q:</b> Can the Creuss <span>Promissory note</span> still be used if the Creuss have not researched “<span>Wormhole Generator</span>”?
</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, the promissory note does not require that the “Wormhole Generator” technology have been researched.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q: </b>Can the “<span>Light/Wave Deflector</span>” technology be used to move through a wormhole created by the Ghosts of Creuss’ “Hil Colish” flagship?
</p><p><b>A: </b>Yes, “Light/Wave Deflector” would allow a player other than the Ghosts of Creuss to move their fleet through the “Hil Colish’s” system into Creuss system or the Creuss Gate system.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: If the “Hil Colish” moves before other ships and is returned to reinforcements by a <span>gravity rift</span>, can other ships still use its delta wormhole to reach the active system?
</p><p>A: No, the wormhole ceases to exist when the “Hil Colish” is returned to reinforcements.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q:</b> If there is an ‘A’ wormhole on <span>Mecatol Rex</span> when the “Ixthian Artifact” <span>agenda</span> causes units in adjacent systems to be destroyed, does the "Quantum Entanglement" ability cause the Ghost of Creuss faction to lose units in a system that contains a ‘B’ wormhole?
</p><p><b>A</b>: No. Only the Creuss treats those systems as adjacent.
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>Q</b>: When multiple ships with capacity move through wormholes, how many fighters are placed with the Ghosts Commander, Sai Seravus?
</p><p><b>A</b>: When Sai Seravus is used, fighters are placed in the active system one at a time, up to the number of ships with capacity that moved through wormholes, or the capacity limit in the system is reached, whichever happens first.
</p><p><br>
<b>Q</b>: How does the Ghosts of Creuss Hero, Singularity Reactor, interact with tokens (e.g. wormholes, Mirage)?
</p><p><b>A:</b> All tokens stay with their original tile.
